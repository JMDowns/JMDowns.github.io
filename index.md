## Welcome to my Custom Page!

This is just something I set up for the KU ACM Programming Club on the 19th of February. Here is a link to KU ACM's [website](https://acmatku.github.io/). 

Do you want to see some code? I do!
```rust

fn hello_world(x: i32) -> i32 {
  for _i in 0..x {
    println!("Hello World!");
  }
}

```

Now, wasn't that just splendid? The code that is used to display all of this is Markdown, which you can learn [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). 
A cheatsheet for Markdown is [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet).

Go wild! You can link to your projects, any work you've done, or even your own resume!
